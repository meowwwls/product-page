# Product Page Example Built with React

**[Live demo](https://vintage-fashion-prints.netlify.com/#)**

**_Please ignore the terribly written CSS. This was one of my first projects ever and in redoing it with React, I wanted to focus just on that and not rewriting the CSS._**

Originally built using vanilla JavaScript, I decided to rebuild this project using React as my second project using the framework. It was the perfect illustration to me of how useful React and other similar frameworks are. Though in total there are many more lines of JavaScript now than there were before, much of the reason is all of the markup is in JS. Regardless of if there is more or less code, it is infinitely more maintainable and easier to read compared to the original, and I am officially sold on React.

At some point, I'd like to experiment with React Transition Group and adding some animations, but for now that was not my focus with this project.
